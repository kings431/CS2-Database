# Placeholder for AK-47 Wear Mask Texture
# 
# This file should be replaced with an actual PNG grayscale mask for wear effects.
# The mask should be:
# - Format: PNG grayscale
# - Resolution: Same as skin texture (1024x1024 or 2048x2048)
# - UV mapping: Same as skin texture
# - Content: Grayscale values where white = no wear, black = maximum wear
# - Purpose: Controls where wear effects appear on the weapon
#
# For development/testing, you can create a simple gradient or noise pattern
# to simulate wear effects on different parts of the weapon.
